marked 1.0.4 (2 July 2012)
------------
NEW FEATURES

* js is now structured the same as cjs and includes all features.

* integrated probitCJS into crm.

* Added automatic data accumulation and creation of freq field where all data fields are the same. See argument accumulate in crm.

* added autoscaling of parameters; see autoscale argument

marked 1.0.3 (4 October 2011)
------------

NEW FEATURES

* Code was modularized to make package easier to extend. js is now structured the same as cjs.

* If time.interval is a field in the Phi design data it will be used as Phi^time.interval.  This allows variation in time intervals across animals as with cohorts of pups branded at different times each year.

* Added probitCJS model and accompanying code.


BUG FIXES

* Change made in cjs.accumulate to compare accumulated frequencies to sum of data frequencies. Previously was using number of rows and would fail if any freq>1.

marked 1.0.2 (30 March 2011)
------------

NEW FEATURES

* Added check on accumulator to report error if sum of frequencies does not match original number of records.

* Added model convergence check and reporting of model convergence message, if non-null.

* Added function fix.parameters to create matrix needed for fixing real parameters 

* Added option to include remove.intercept=TRUE in model.parameters list for each parameter to force removal of intercept. 

* Added refit argument to crm, cjs and js to control number of refittings if model doesn't converge.

* Added function create.links which works out which real parameters can use a sin link.  Code was added to cjs and cjs.lnl to use the sin link where appropriate.  This is commented out at present!  Not sure it is working correctly.

* Uses optimx function for optimization which allows more methods and multiple methods to be selected.

BUG FIXES

* Fixed issue with capture history accumulator when chunk_size was larger than needed. Added 1 to pieces.

* Beta estimate names were lost once sparse matrices were implemented and this was fixed.

* Made change to accumulation code to correct error introduced in last version with fixed parameters.

* Made fixes to js to accommodate accumulation. 
  
marked 1.0.1 (22 March 2011)
------------

NEW FEATURES

* Added use of sparse matrices for design matrices which sped up code and reduced memory consumption. The argument chunk_size was added to crm, create.dm,cjs, and js to control amount of memory usage.

* Added run timing and various print statements to track progress of model.  If debug=FALSE, includes function evaluation counter (every 100) and neg lnl which remains on same line unless used in Rterm.

marked 1.0.0 (Initial posting 2011)
------------

NEW FEATURES

* Extracted crm and accompanying code from RMark and created initial base package.
