Title: R Code for mark-recapture analysis
Author: Jeff Laake <jeff.laake@noaa.gov>
Description: This package provides a framework for handling data and
        analysis models for mark-recapture problems. Currently it is 
        limited to Cormack-Jolly-Seber and Jolly-Seber type models but
        the idea is to create an open package where researchers can add 
        models into a common framework.
Depends: R (>= 2.12.0), Matrix, optimx
Suggests: RMark
LazyLoad: yes
