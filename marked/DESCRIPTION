Description: Functions for fitting various models to capture-recapture data
    including fixed and mixed-effects Cormack-Jolly-Seber(CJS) for survival
    estimation and POPAN structured Jolly-Seber models for abundance
    estimation. Includes a CJS models that concurrently estimates and corrects
    for tag loss. Hidden Markov model (HMM) implementations of CJS and
    multistate models with and without state uncertainty.
