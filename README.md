marked - mark-recapture analysis
=======================================

We developed this R package for analysis with marked animals in 
contrast to the R package unmarked (Fiske and Chandler 2011) that 
focuses on analysis with unmarked animals. The original impetus 
for the package was to implement the CJS model using the hierarchical 
likelihood construction described by Pledger et al. (2003) and to 
improve on execution times with RMark/MARK (White and Burnham 1999;Laake 2013)
for analysis of our own large data sets with many time-varying 
individual (animal-specific) covariates. Subsequently, we implemented 
the Jolly-Seber model with the Schwarz and Arnason (1996) POPAN 
structure where the hierarchical likelihood construction idea extended 
to the entry of animals into the population. We also added a 
Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) implementation of the 
CJS model based on the approach used by Albert and Chib (1993) for 
analyzing binary data with a probit regression model. 

This package requires installation of ADMB if you set use.admb=TRUE.
