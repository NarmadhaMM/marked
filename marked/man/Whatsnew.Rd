\title{Summary of changes by version}
\description{
  A good place to look for new changes.  Often I'll add
  changes here but don't always get to it in the
  documentation for awhile.  They are ordered from newest
  to oldest.
}
\details{
  Version 1.0.3 ( May 2011) \itemize{ \item Code
  modularization to make package easier to extend. \item If
  \code{time.interval} is a field in the Phi design data it
  will be used as Phi^time.interval.  This allows variation
  in time intervals across animals as with cohorts of pups
  branded at different times each year.

  } Version 1.0.2 ( March 2011) \itemize{ \item Fixed issue
  with capture history accumulator when chunk_size was
  larger than needed. Added 1 to pieces. \item Added check
  on accumulator to report error if sum of frequencies does
  not match original number of records. \item Added model
  convergence check and reporting of model convergence
  message, if non-null. \item Beta estimate names were lost
  once sparse matrices were implemented and this was fixed.
  \item Added function \code{\link{fix.parameters}} to
  create matrix needed for fixing real parameters \item
  Made change to accumulation code to correct error
  introduced in last version with fixed parameters. \item
  Added option to include \code{remove.intercept=TRUE} in
  \code{model.parameters} list for each parameter to force
  removal of intercept. \item Added \code{refit} argument
  to \code{crm},\code{cjs} and \code{js} to control number
  of refittings if model doesn't converge. \item Added
  function \code{create.links} which works out which real
  parameters can use a sin link.  Code was added to
  \code{\link{cjs}} and \code{\link{cjs.lnl}} to use the
  sin link where appropriate.  This is commented out at
  present!  Not sure it is working correctly. \item Uses
  optimx function for optimization which allows more
  methods and multiple methods to be selected. \item Made
  fixes to \code{\link{js}} to accommodate accumulation. }
  Version 1.0.1 (22 March 2011) \itemize{ \item Added use
  of sparse matrices for design matrices which sped up code
  and reduced memory consumption. The argument chunk_size
  was added to \code{\link{crm}},
  \code{\link{create.dm}},\code{\link{cjs}}, and
  \code{\link{js}} to control amount of memory usage. \item
  Added run timing and various print statements to track
  progress of model.  If debug=FALSE, includes function
  evaluation counter (every 100) and neg lnl which remains
  on same line unless used in Rterm.  \item Note that js
  model needs further testing after these changes. }
  Version 1.0.0 (Initial posting 2011) \itemize{ \item
  Extracted crm and accompanying code from RMark and
  created base package which was posted on bitbucket. }
