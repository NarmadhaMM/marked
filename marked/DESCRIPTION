Title: Mark-Recapture Analysis for Survival and Abundance Estimation
Author: Jeff Laake <jefflaake@gmail.com>, Devin Johnson

Maintainer: Jeff Laake <jefflaake@gmail.com>
Description: Functions for fitting various models to capture-recapture data
    including mixed-effects Cormack-Jolly-Seber(CJS) and multistate models
    and the multi-variate state model structure of Johnson et al. (2015) for survival
    estimation and POPAN structured Jolly-Seber models for abundance
    estimation. There are also Hidden Markov model (HMM) implementations of CJS and
    multistate models with and without state uncertainty and a simulation capability for HMM models.
